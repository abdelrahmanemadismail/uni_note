The aim of enhancement to better appearance , noise removal and facilitates processing steps
Image enhancement techniques can be divided into two categories :
- Spatial domain methods : which operate directly on pixels.
- Frequency domain methods: which operate on the fourier transform of an image.
Image enhancement Classification/application:
- Pixel based / Point based
	- Only deals with the point or pixel
- Region based
	- Deals with the neighbors of the pixel in the region
- Global entire Image
	- Deals with the whole image

# Image negative
Reproduces the bright parts of image as dark and the dark part as light areas
- $f'(x,y)_{negative image} = (L-1)-f(x,y)_{original image}$
- $L_{(gray level)} =2^q (q=No.\ of\ bits.\ if\ q=8,\ then\ L=2^8=256)$
- Negative simple program
```
for i=0, i<N, i++:
	for j=0, j<M, j++:
		fe(i,j) = (L-1)-f(i,j)
	end; //j
end; //i
```
# Contrast stretching and contraction
## Contrast stretching / histogram stretching
- There are two methods of enhancing contrast
	- histogram stretching that increase contrast
	- histogram equalization
#note Stretching mean improve or increase contrast

## Contrast contraction
- Algorithm that can solve the problem of objects are seen as multi-agents due to difference in gray value
## Dynamic Range Stretching
**The Dynamic Range :** it is the range in which the image details exist.
#note So the focus is to increase the range with contracting dark towards darker and white towards whiter.

$r1 > S1 & r2 < S2$

- First line: 0 --> r1
$$f'(x,y) = f(x,y)\frac{S1}{r1}$$
- Second line r1 --> r2
$$f'(x,y) = f(x,y)\frac{S2-s1}{r2-r1}+S1-r1\frac{S2-s1}{r2-r1}$$
- Third line r2 --> 255
$$f'(x,y) = f(x,y)\frac{(L-1)-s2}{(L-1)-r2}+(L-1)-(L-1)\frac{(L-1)-s2}{(L-1)-r2}$$

#Answer 
Range of gray image
1. first line: 0 --> 125
	- $f'(x,y)=f(x,y)$
2. second line : 125 --> 187
	- $f'(x,y)=255$
3. third line : 187 --> 255
	- $f'(x,y)=f(x,y)$

# Bit plan slicing
An image could be seen as a set of plans where a plain is the set of pixels bit with the same weight #Example for an image with 256 grays will mean each pixel gray assigned 8-bit gray value, this means that such an image could have 8 plains a plain per each bit
# Histogram equalization
**Normalized Histogram :** it gives the probability of each number in the dataset, or we can say that is gives the count of frequency of each element.

**Histogram equalization** Used for enhancing contrast of image 
- full range
- in range
**Full range rules**
- Total count = $\varepsilon$ count
- probability = $\frac{Gray count}{Total count}$
- Cumulative == $\varepsilon$ probability
- Equalized = cumulative * 255
**In range rules**
- Total count = $\varepsilon$ count
- probability = $\frac{Gray count}{Total count}$
- Cumulative == $\varepsilon$ probability
- Equalized =min + cumulative * (max gray - min gray)

#Example find the full range and in range equalized histogram of the following image matrix.
