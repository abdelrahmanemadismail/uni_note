# What is Computer vision?
- computer vision is the use of seen as a major input that control actions.
- computer vision is the science of using image processing to make it useful, extract data or learn something from image.
# What is Image Processing?
- Image processing means to perform objective operations on the images, to extract data form it.
# Sample Computer vision Systems:
- Smart bombs / Smart missiles
- Security systems (face recognition, finger prints)
- Material analysis
- Machine Control
- Medical (X-ray, Sonar, Radiation and analysis)
- Auto-Drive
- Robotics
- Motion Detection

## The Basic Elements of computer vision system
- Acquisition
- Enhancement
- Restoration
- Segmentation
- Description
- Feature extraction
- Detection
- Recognition
- Encoding/Decoding
# Acquisition
is the process of converting a scene to a digital image through **Sampling** and **Quantization** 
## Sampling
- is Dividing the image into samples `N in x` and `M in y` as result we will have `MxN` picture elements which is called pixels
## Quantization
- is the process of converting analog image to digital image grouping a set of grays/colors into gray value or a specific color as result will have matrix at dimension `MxN`.
- Number of possible colors/grays are 2$^q$
- #note Image resolution is `MxNxq`
## False contouring / Coarse sampling
- Insufficient number of intensity levels in smooth areas of digital image

|  Fine sampling  |  Coarse sampling |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Good image | poor image |
| Precise description | false contouring |
| High memory requirements | low memory requirements |
| need a lot of processing power | low processing power |
| Transmit require high bandwidth | low bandwidth sufficient |

# Image resolution
- refers to the number of pixels in an image
- identified by the width and height of the image and number of colors in an image #note `R = MxNxq`
# Digital image
- is an Image matrix which is finite matrix of integer values or 3 image matrices of color images
# Image Matrix

| if max gray level | 130 --> Dark Image | 255 --> no meaning |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------------| ---------------- |
|  if min gray level | 170 --> bright | 0 --> no meaning |
| (max & min) | (100, 150) low contrast | (0, 255) no meaning |
| Average | 50 Dark | 200 Bright | 127 no meaning |
| stander deviation | big --> high contrast | low --> low contrast|





# Histogram :
**count the number of occurrences per gray/color/color component value within the image matrix/matrices.**
## Importance applications of histogram 
- Analysis of image, image brightness
- using histogram to equalize an image

#Example Calculate the Following for the following Matrix: Find histogram
$$\begin{pmatrix} 5&5&4&5 \\ 10&20&5&4 \\ 10&20&5&10 \\ 20&4&5&100 \end{pmatrix}$$

| Grey Value | Count |
| ---- | ----- |
|4|3|
|5|6|
|10|3|
|20|3|

|Total count|16|

# Neighboring
**Relation between pixels in some way.**
## Types of Neighboring :
- four neighboring $$ N_4(f(x,y)) = \{ f(x-1, y), f(x+1, y), f(x, y-1),  f(x, y+1) \} $$ ![[Pasted image 20231229092438.png]]
- diagonal neighboring $$ N_D(f(x,y)) = \{ f(x-1, y-1), f(x-1, y+1), f(x+1, y-1),  f(x+1, y+1) \} $$ ![[Pasted image 20231229092540.png]]
- Eight neighboring $$ N_8(f(x, y)) = \{N_D \cup  N_4\} $$ ![[Pasted image 20231229092609.png]]

# Connectivity:
**Pixels are considered connected if and only if**
- They're neighbors
- $f(𝑥_1, 𝑦_1), f(𝑥_2, 𝑦_2) \in 𝜉$ ➔ Where $𝜉$ is the gray levels connectivity set $𝜉 = \{ ..., ..., ... \}$

#Example: find connected pixels for $f(1,1)$ using $N_4$ and connectivity set $𝜉 = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$ . Redo using $N_D, N_8$
![[Pasted image 20231229093937.png]]
#Answer
In case of, $N_4$ 5 is connected with $f(1,0)=4$ and $f(0,1)=6$
In case of, $N_D$ 5 is connected with $f(2,0)=7$ and $f(2,2)=9$
In case of, $N_4$ 5 is connected with $f(1,0)=4$, $f(0,1)=6$, $f(2,0)=7$ and $f(2,2)=9$

# Image Path
**The Image path is a sequence of connected pixels starts at the first pixel $f(x_1,y_1)$ and ends at $f(x_n,y_n)$**
#Example Find the Image Path Between $f(1,1)$ and $f(3,5)$
- Giving the connectivity set $𝜉 = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$

| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 2 | ==2== | ==5== | ==6== | 9 | 8 | 7 | 
| 4 | 5 | 2 | ==3== | 0 | 1 | 2 |

| 8 | 8 | 8 | ==6== | 7 | 9 | 8 | 
| 7 | 7 | 7 | 8 | 6 | 7 | 5 |  

# Connected Regions
A set of pixels of an image such that 
- Between any two pixels inside there exist at lest on image path
- There exits no image path between any other pixel outside and an inside one
- #note An object within an image is a connected region
Region: is the group of connected pixels.
Labeling is a mean to find out the regions that exists within an image matrix
#Example get the labels for the pixels satisfying the rule of $ξ=\{ 0-->20\}$ and neighbor $N_8$

|100|100|100|110|120|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|110|90|==5== |==7== |100|
|==5== |100|==6== |110|120|
|==7== |100|100|120|10|
|110|==5== |70 |110|==8== |
|111|110|==7== |==10== |120|
finally, the found labels are $L1, L2$
$L1 = \{ f(2,1),f(3,1),f(2,2) \}$
$L2 = \{ f(0,2),f(0,3),f(1,4),f(2,5),f(3,5),f(4,3),f(f(4,4) \}$

# Distance Metrics
1. Euclidian: $\Delta(f(x_1,y_1),f(x_2,y_2))=\sqrt{ (x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2 }$
2. City Blocks: $\Delta(f(x_1,y_1),f(x_2,y_2))=\vert{x_1-x_2}\vert+\vert{y_1-y_2}\vert$
3. Chess Board:$\Delta(f(x_1,y_1),f(x_2,y_2))=\max(\vert{x_1-x_2}\vert, \vert{y_1-y_2}\vert)$
